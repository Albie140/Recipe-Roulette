# Recipe Roulette

feature/api-testing-javascript-file
Recipe Roulette is a recipe generating app created for anyone who has a general idea of a food they would like to eat. The user enters a food item clicks search then the app returns a meal recipe containing that food and a cocktail. Our goal was to create a user interface that is sleek, modern, and aesthetically pleasing. We used the Framework UI Kit as well as the Work Sans Google Font to achieve this goal.

&nbsp;

Designed for those who are looking to try something completely new for any meal of the day!
